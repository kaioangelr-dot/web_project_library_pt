                  The Alchemist (Portuguese: O Alquimista) is a novel by
                  Brazilian author Paulo Coelho which was first published in
                  1988. Originally written in Portuguese, it became a widely
                  translated international bestseller. The story follows
                  Santiago, a shepherd boy, in his journey across North Africa
                  to the Egyptian pyramids after he dreams of finding treasure
                  there.

                  The Hound of the Baskervilles is the third of the four crime
                  novels by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle featuring the
                  detective Sherlock Holmes. Originally serialised in The Strand
                  Magazine from August 1901 to April 1902, it is set largely in
                  Dartmoor, Devon, in England's West Country and follows Holmes
                  and Watson investigating the legend of a fearsome, diabolical
                  hound of supernatural origin. One of the most famous stories
                  ever written.

                <p class="card__text">
                  A Song of Ice and Fire depicts a violent world dominated by
                  political realism. What little supernatural power exists is
                  confined to the margins of the known world. Moral ambiguity
                  pervades the books, and many of the storylines frequently
                  raise questions concerning loyalty, pride, corruption, and the
                  morality of violence. The story unfolds through an alternating
                  set of subjective points of view, the success or survival of
                  any of which is never assured.

                  The Shining centers on Jack Torrance, a struggling writer and
                  recovering alcoholic who accepts a position as the off-season
                  caretaker of the historic Overlook Hotel in the Colorado
                  Rockies. His family accompanies him on this job, including his
                  young son, Danny, who possesses "the shining", an array of
                  psychic abilities that allow the child to glimpse the hotel's
                  horrific true nature.
